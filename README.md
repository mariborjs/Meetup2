# MariborJS - JavaScript Meetups https://www.meetup.com/MariborJS/
### Agenda:

**Session:** Angular Universal - server side rendering vs build rendering

**Speaker:** Blaž Miheljak

**Affiliations:** Catenate

**Description:**

Angular Universal allows server side rendering of Angular applications with the use of NodeJS. But if we have a finite number of routes with a deterministic output, we can also use build rendering. We will present the seed project and the steps needed for build rendering.

**Session:** Building full screen apps with Vue.js

**Speaker:** Mato Žgajner

**Affiliations:** United.Cloud

**Description:**

Modern web applications are most common used either on personal computers with a mouse and a keyboard or on mobile devices with touch input. Frameworks and libraries are often designed specifically for these use cases, even though there are many other ways to interact with applications. The talk will focus on the details of developing a web app intended for use on Smart TVs with the Vue.js framework. It will present specific issues that were encountered during development and attempt to assess the usefulness of the framework for this particular use case.

**Session:** RawModelJS

**Speaker:**  Kristijan Sedlak

**Affiliations:** Doctrina

**Description:**

Let's admit it! Most of the time developers write data structures, validation logic and error handling stuff, thus having the right tools to speed-up the development is extremely important. Kristijan Sedlak will dive into the data modeling in NodeJS using RawModelJS. He will explain the incentives that led to this open-source package and will share his experience on how to build a long-term sustainable back-end services.
